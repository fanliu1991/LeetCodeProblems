Given a non-negative index k where k â‰¤ 33, 
return the k-th index row of the Pascal's triangle.

Note that the row index starts from 0.

In Pascal's triangle, 
each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Example:
Input: 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]

Explanation: 
[
     [1],
    [1,1],
   [1,2,1],
  [1,3,3,1],
 [1,4,6,4,1]
]

        When generating each row, we can use the previous row directly.
        For each new row, we append a 1 to the head of previous row, 
        and let i iterate from row[2] to row[-2], 
        and set row[i] = row[i] + row[i+1]

        e.g.
        row index = 4, previous row = [1,3,3,1]
        append a 1 to previous row, row = [1,1,3,3,1]
        after row[i] = row[i] + row[i+1],

        Any row can be constructed using the offset sum of the previous row.

Complexity Analysis
Time complexity : O(k^2).
    We need to compute k-2 elements for k-th row.

Space complexity : O(k).
    We need k+1 spaces to store the k-th row.
